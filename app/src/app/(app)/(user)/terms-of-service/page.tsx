        <p>
          The Customer or the person authorized to receive the order shall
          verify the order and the products upon its receipt. In case the
          Customer or the person authorized to receive the order detects any
          damage or anomaly in the package or in the product, or the absence of
          any product ordered, they must refuse the delivery and promptly
          contact Alphasuits’s Customer Service (contact details below).
        </p>
        <p>
          If the damage or anomaly is detected only after the conclusion of the
          delivery, the Customer or the person authorized to receive the order
          must promptly contact Alphasuits’s Customer Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any damage or anomaly must be reported to Customer Service within 5
          working days after receipt. Customer Service will conduct a thorough
          analysis of the issue reported. In the event that Customer Service
          concludes that the damage or anomaly was Alphasuits’s or the carrier’s
          fault, Alphasuits will replace the defective/damaged items by sending
          a new shipment OR refund the amount spent on the items with anomalies,
          according to the Customer’s best interests.
        </p>

        <p>
          The above-mentioned delivery times are merely indicative and may vary
          during promotional campaigns, sales, or other. If the delivery times
          are not met, the Customer may contact Customer Service. The Customer

          delivery.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notwithstanding the foregoing, Alphasuits will ship the order at most
          30 days after the conclusion of the agreement in accordance with
          paragraph 9.2. If Alphasuits is unable to deliver the order within
          this timeframe due to the unavailability of the products, we will
          inform the Customer and fully reimburse them within 30 days of such
          unavailability.
